      <p><em>Shadowfax</em> was our competition vehicle for 2011. The overall vehicle is a very traditional recumbent, see the table below for more information. The fairing for <em>Shadowfax</em> is made of two layers of carbon-fiber, which was formed in two halves using a male mold made from foam. You can find out more about our vehicle and fabrication techniques by downloading our full design report.</p>

      <h3>Prototype Vehicle - <em>Bilius</em></h3>
      <p><em>Bilius</em> was our prototype vehicle built in the fall of 2010. Many concepts and new methods were tested on <em>Bilius</em>. The most notable features are non-linear stearing achived via two elipses and a taught cable, a front fork with multiple dropouts for testing rake and trail, and welding using a new frame jig constructed from 80-20 extrusion.</p>
