      <p>In the 2009 ASME HPVC east Olin's team placed 3rd overall out of 20 teams in the speed class, behind Rose-Hulman and Missouri S&T. Highlights of the 2009 build season include our infamous "golf ball" fairing and a great 3rd place finish in the Women's sprint event.</p>

      <p><em>Helios</em> was our competition vehicle for 2009. The vehicle is a traditional low-riding recumbent; see more details on <em>Helios</em> in the table below or take a look at our design report. The most interesting part of the build was our fairing construction, which involved designing a fairing shape in solidworks CAD and then constructing this shape out of a cardboard honeycomb for layup.</p>

      <h3>Prototype Vehicle - <em>B-Wagon</em></h3>
      <p>The prototype vehicle built in fall 2008 was the <em>B-Wagon</em>, and has become one of the stable bikes of Olin HPV. This bike is very similar to Helios but has a shorter wheel base and the rear derailer has since been removed, making it a single-speed. The handling of <em>B-Wagon</em> is very forgiving - this is the first bike we give anyone who is just learning how to ride a recumbent.</p>
