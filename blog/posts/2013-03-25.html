      2013 Design Report
    </a>
  </h2>
  <h6>March 25, 2013</h6>

  <p>Each year, the team prepares a comprehensive design report to document our team's vehicle and processes. This report is also annually submitted to the ASME Human Powered Vehicles Challenge and is judged as part of the competition.</p>
  <p>The report presented below was prepared over the last couple weeks by a huge group effort of all team members working to create this polished product. This year, we made our report in LaTeX and the process was very smooth.</p>
  <p>The final report is available <a href='http://hpv.olin.edu/files/2013OlinCollegeDesignReport.pdf' target=_blank>here</a>. We're proud of the final report. We hope you enjoy it too. </p>
