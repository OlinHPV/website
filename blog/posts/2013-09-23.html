      Hub on Wheels
    </a>
  </h2>
  <h6>September 23, 2013</h6>

  <p>Yesterday, the team volunteered at the 9<sup>th</sup> annual Boston Hub on Wheels citywide bike ride. We've been participating for a number of wheels and had most of the team and a number of other Olin students involved.</p>

  <p>This year, we were stationed at a rest stop right along the harbor in South Boston. While the day began cold and dreary, it ended up nice and sunny. We even managed to get a little bit of beach time in between waves of bikers. Most years, the majority of the team has biked in to Boston for the race (about 15 miles, leaving Olin at 5:30am). However, due to the morning rain, only a couple brave souls decided to head in on bike in the dark.</p>

  <p>Hub on Wheels is always a lot of fun for everyone who goes. What better way to bond than through bike-themed volunteering. We're already looking forward to next year.</p>
