      Fall Design Review
    </a>
  </h2>
  <h6>November 30, 2012</h6>

  <p>This past Thursday, our team had our first Design Review of the year.  Almost all of our new team members presented on some aspect of the vehicle and we gained some valuable comments and suggestions on our design and planned manufacturing processes.</p>
  <p>We had a great turn out with a number of members of the Olin College student body, faculty and staff, all of which made fantastic contributions.  Our next formal presentation will be at the Olin EXPO in December.</p>
  <p>The presentation is shown below.  In addition to the design review, we have recently continued manufacture of our vehicle's prototype landing gear.  The landing gear concept as a whole is coming together great but there are several aspects of the ratcheting deployment mechanism that are not quite working as designed.</p>
