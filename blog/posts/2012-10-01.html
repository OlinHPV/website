      New Team Website

  <h6>October 1, 2012</h6>

  <p>Over the past few weeks, several team members have been hard at work revamping our team's website. We have made an effort to make the website more modern and have also added a blog.  We will be using this blog to post frequent updates on our team's progress during the year.</p>
  <p>The website was programmed using HTML, CSS & PHP.  The core CSS layouts were done with help from <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/' target=_blank>Bootstrap</a>.  The blog was written froms scratch in PHP and was designed to be simple to post to, read and use.</p>
