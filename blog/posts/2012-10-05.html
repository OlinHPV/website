      Kazak Sponsor Visit
    </a>
  </h2>
  <h6>October 5, 2012</h6>

  <p>Today, several team members traveled with our vehicle <em>Seabagel</em> to the headquarters of <a href='http://kazakcomposites.com/index.html' target=_blank>Kazak Composites</a>, one of our team's primary sponsors.  Kazak is a composite engineering company and is one of the world's leaders in composite pultrusion, a method for quickly and economically producing composite strictures.  For several years, Kazak has donated carbon fiber and fiberglass to the team, with which we have made our vehicles's fairings.</p>
  <p>The Olin Human Powered Vehicles team presented to Kazak's employees over lunch on our program and answered questions about our vehicle.  The Kazak employees gave us valuable pointers on composite design and manufacture techniques. We also demonstrated the vehicle in the company parking lot.</p>
  <p>What we do is only possible thanks to the help of Kazak and we are happy and proud to have their generous sponsorship.</p>
